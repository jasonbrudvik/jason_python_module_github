## USING THIS MODULE
If you want to make use of this module, install it via pip into your virtual
environment.

If you don't have a virtual environment, you can make one with either pip
or conda.  I prefer conda:
```bash
make venv
```

This will download  a small version conda (miniconda) and install it into
the directory venv/.

Now activate the environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate

And install jason_python_module_github via pip:
Look at the usage information for this module by typing it's name in the
terminal:
```
```bash
pip install jason_python_module_github
```

Now execute the "hello" function using the arguments "Jason" and "Florian":
```bash
jason_python_module_github --hello Jason Florian
```
